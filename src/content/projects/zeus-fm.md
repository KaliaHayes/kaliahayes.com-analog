## The Inspiration: A Retired Spotify Feature

In the early days of Spotify, users enjoyed a feature called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-01-22-spotifys-touch-preview.html" target="_blank">Touch Preview</a> that allowed them to press and hold a track to preview a 30-second snippet — a brief yet insightful glimpse that often determined whether the song would make it to their carefully curated playlists. This feature, though now retired, was an exciting and intuitive innovation that made discovering new music a breeze.

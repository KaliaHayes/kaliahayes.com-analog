## Kolada: The Dark Mode Oasis

In the realm of coding, the tools you choose are not just utilities but integral elements shaping your development journey. Step into the world of Kolada, a groundbreaking Visual Studio Code extension that revolutionizes the Dark Mode experience by infusing it with a burst of vibrant, tropical colors.

Kolada breaks free from the conventional constraints of traditional dark themes. It introduces a vivid tropical palette featuring an array of captivating colors â€“ shades of pink, blue, orange, purple, and green dance harmoniously against a solid black background, creating a visual masterpiece that transcends the ordinary.

## Creating Kolada

Kolada was created using [Yo Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension), a Visual Studio Code extension generator. The extension was built using TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing to the language.

To curate the perfect color palette, I leveraged [The VS Code Theme Editor](https://themes.vscode.one/) as a fully-stocked, robust starting point, then tweaked the colors to my liking by updating the `theme.json` file (and I'll continue to tweak the theme!).
